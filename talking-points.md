- Everyone has ideas (the structure of science revolutions)

Have you ever found it strange that groups of people across the globe some out
with similar products at the same time. Have you ever thought "Wow, I thought of that
idea a few years ago, I could have been a billionaire!". That is a trap. It is mostly likely
someone else has the same idea as you, and might be working on it already.

Sometimes our jobs as Engineers (or even entrepreneurs) is to understand what it takes
to bring to reality. We need to figure out how to get from point A (nothing) to point B (product).

## Point A is easy:

* Have an idea
* List out the things the idea solves

## Point B is much harder:

* Take the list of ideas and turn them into software

## "turn ideas into software"

What does that even mean. Think about it this for a minute. You are taking an idea, and creating something from nothing.
We haven't even talked about what the idea could be. It could be a game, it could be art, it could be music,
or it could be a boring product the world needs.

## I don't think the hard parts are the code

In the real world we don't really get specifications. If I am told exactly what the output is, and just code it, 
that would be easy. The reality is, I need to come up with many small solutions along the way (which no one else cares about)
in order to build a thing.

## Prototyping

As a front end engineer, it is a lot easier to see what I am doing. This means I can sometimes get away with "give me a few days
and we can test this idea", and give a relatable outcome to non technical people.
