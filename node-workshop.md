# Node Workshop

## About me

Fullstack engineer, currently working for Recruiting Ventures (Recruiting.com/Jobing.com) where we build services for recruiting and HR departments.

contact me on twitter @richardiii, or on github @rtorr

Most of my career has been focused on web applications. Nodejs is the tool I am choosing for a lot of my new projects (where is makes sense)

## What is Nodejs?

What the website says:

"Node.jsÂ® is a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine. Node.js uses an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model that makes it lightweight and efficient. Node.js' package ecosystem, npm, is the largest ecosystem of open source libraries in the world."

Basically nodejs gives you a javascript runtime on your computer or server. Meaning, you can do many more things with Javascript than you could in the past. We used to only really run JavaScript in the browser. 

Now you can write local commandline tools, web servers, program hardware (including robots), and use npm to package your libraries!

This was just to give you the idea that its not all about writing web apps, or web servies.

## Why Nodejs?

* The NPM repository is the largest ecostyem in the world. If you need to do something with code, NPM probably has a package or library to help you along the way. 

Image you need to process some images, count the colors that exist in the image, and translate that into data. There is a package for that. Need help with HTTP? There is a package for that. Want to write programs for your Arduino? Again, that is on there too. Want to publish your code to share with the world? Its super easy.

* JavaScript

JavaScript is by far the most popular programming language out there right now. That is because web browsers are every where. With the new coined term "Internet of Things", I assume browsers and web applications will only continue to be included in more places.

It would be weird for me _not_ to advise you to learn JavaScript. It will help you where ever you go, if you choose to write software.


# Web Development (where we are)

* How to move an idea to code

- Everyone has ideas (the stucture of science revolutions)
- Prototyping an idea

## What I use right now

* Real time feedback

- CSS/Javascript - talk about how this improves development
- Optimisic updates

* Tools

- Node/npm
- Webpack

* JavaScript (the argument for)

- Functional/OO

## Where we are

- Some people may never visit your app from a desktop (this is not mobile first, but mobile only)

## Where we will be

- Offline
- Service worker - Programable cache layer
- feather app (henrik jorteg)
- Micro services

* Demo

* Taking a prototype to the real world

- An advantage you can have is really studing a technology to the point where you can work from a prototype and see
how it will transition to a real product. Saving yourself from re-doing a lot of work
